// TrueBlocks-Node
//
// TrueBlocks-Node serves three purposes:
//
// 1. Actively index EVM blockchains for address appearances,
// 2. Provide an optional API server for the trueblocks API as well as provide endpoints to control other aspects of the node including pinning, publishing, and monitoring, and
// 3. Monitor a given set of user-defined addresses.
//
// More information is available for each of these three components in their respective modules.
