/*
TrueBlocks-Node serves three purposes:

 1. Actively index EVM blockchains,
 2. Improve EVM's data APIs to make consuming data easier and more efficient (including a built-in cache), and
 3. Monitor transactions for a given set of user-defined addresses.

More information is available for each of these three components in their respective documentation.
